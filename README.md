# Advent of Code 2022

[Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022)  
This year, I'm doing it in [Go](https://go.dev), again.

## Use

Each day's challenge is inside its own folder.  
The input for the challenge is in that same folder in a file called input.txt.

Run `go run dayN/main.go` from the root folder to run the Nth challenge.  
It is necessary to run it from the root directory as I hardcoded the path to the input file.
